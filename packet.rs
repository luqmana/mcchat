/**
 * The Packet struct has a type parameter that isn't used in any
 * of it's field (i.e. a phantom type). We use it to only implement
 * certain methods for certain kinds of packets. This works since
 * the struct itself is private and the only way to get a Packet is
 * through one of two static methods: `new_in` and `new_out`.
 *
 * Packet<In> is basically just a wrapper around some buffer. It
 * represents a complete packet that we've read in. We also
 * implement the Reader trait to make it more convenient to
 * access the data it encompasses.
 *
 * Packet<Out> represents a buffer we can write to as we build
 * up a complete packet. It implements the Writer trait so we can
 * use all those convenient methods.
